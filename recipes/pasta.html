        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>1 large onion, diced</li>
            <li>1 tsp dried oregano</li>
            <li>1 stp dried thyme(optional, can sub for more oregano)</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tsp kosher salt, plus more to taste</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1(5.3 oz)(150g) tube of tomato paste</li>
            <li>1/2 cup(120 ml) dry red wine, optional</li>
            <li>1 cup(185g) red lentils, soaked</li>
            <li>¼ cup (32g) walnuts (or pecans), crushed finely</li>
            <li>1 (14.5-ounce/410g) can of crushed tomatoes or whole peeled tomatoes, crushed by hand***</li>
            <li>12-16 ounces (340-454g) long, wide pasta (such as tagliatelle, pappardelle, or fettuccine; <br> or tube pasta such as rigatoni or penne rigate; or gnocchi)****</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon high-quality balsamic vinegar*****</li>
            <li>Flat-leaf Italian parsley or fresh basil, chopped or slivered (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Soak the 1 cup of lentils in water for 30 minutes, or up to 60 minutes.<br>
                 Meanwhile, prep all the other ingredients (i.e., chop the onions and garlic, chop the walnuts, etc.)</li>
            <li>Heat a 12-inch deep sauté pan or Dutch oven on medium-high heat. Add the olive oil, <br>
                and once it’s shimmering, add the onions and season with a pinch of salt.<br>
                 Stir occasionally and cook the onions until a light brown fond starts form on the surface<br> 
                of the pan, about 5 minutes. Add a few spoons of water to deglaze the pan, and stir.<br>
                 Continue cooking the onions, adding more water every few minutes and stirring frequently<br>
                  to prevent burning, until the onions are softened and golden brown, 9-10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the garlic, thyme, oregano, 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, and pepper to taste.<br>
                 Stir frequently and cook for 60-90 seconds.</li>
            <li>Stir in the tomato paste and cook for 2-3 minutes to caramelize, stirring very frequently,<br>
                 until it’s darker red in color.</li>
            <li>Optional: If using the red wine, pour the wine into the pan and deglaze, scraping up any <br>
                browned bits. Cook for 1-2 minutes, until the smell of alcohol has burned off and the mixture is jammy.</li>
            <li>Pour in the broth to deglaze the pan, stirring any browned bits on the bottom of the pot and<br>
                 stirring the broth into the tomato paste to combine. Add the lentils and walnuts, and stir<br>
                  to incorporate. Heat until the mixture comes to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low<br>
                   to maintain a rapid simmer for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Add the crushed tomatoes and simmer for another 15-20 minutes, or until the lentils<br>
                 are tender but still al dente, stirring occasionally to prevent burning and sticking.<br>
                If using crushed tomatoes, you may need to add a little water or lower the heat <br>
                as needed to prevent burning. I prefer to cook for 20 minutes for a more developed flavor.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil and salt generously. Add the pasta and<br>
                 cook until just al dente. Reserve a ladle or so of pasta water (may not need it). <br>
                 Drain the pasta but do not rinse it.</li>
            <li>Taste the bolognese for seasonings, adding more salt and pepper to taste.<br>
                 Finish with the balsamic vinegar (or sugar)****, and stir to combine.</li>
            <li>Add the hot cooked pasta to the bolognese and toss until well coated in the sauce,<br>
                 adding a bit of pasta water as needed to ensure the sauce coats the noodles.</li>
            <li> Garnish with chopped parsley or basil, if using.</li>
        </ol>
