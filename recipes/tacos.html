        <li>Fresh Cilantro</li>
        <ul></ul>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut the Mexican dried chilies stems off and open and then remove the seeds.<br>
                 Tear them into smaller pieces by hand.</li>
            <li>Start shredding oyster mushrooms by using your hands.</li>
            <li>Heat the frying pan on medium-low heat with a tablespoon of oil, <br>
                slightly fried the chili peppers for 2 minutes to bring out the fragrance.<br>
                 Then add sliced white onion, garlic, maple syrup and spices( ground all spice,<br>
                  ground cumin, ground cinnamon, dried oregano, dried marjoram), cook until onions<br>
                   become transparent. Pour in the vegetable stock, let it simmer for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Transfer everything in the frying pan into the blender. Blend at high speed <br>
                until the mixture becomes a smooth puree. Preserve one cup of Birria Consomé<br>
                  for brushing tortillas and dipping for later use. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat the frying pan on high heat with one tablespoon of oil, we gonna sauté the<br>
                 oyster mushrooms until golden brown color. ( a little bit over-cooked, as we want<br>
                  the chewy texture from cooked mushrooms). Add the birria sauce to the mushrooms,<br>
                   turn the heat to low, constantly stir and let it simmer for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Heat up another pan on medium heat with oil. Place corn tortillas in the pan<br>
                 and brush them with our previously saved birria sauce. Flip and brush the other side.<br>
                  (If you like crispy taco, you do need more cooking oil to fry the tortillas. If not enough oil, they won't get crispy).</li>
            <li>Place around a half cup of oyster mushroom mixture on each tortilla, and add a spoonful of vegan cheese on the top of the mixture.</li>
            <li>Fold them into halves like tacos. Press the vegan birria tacos with a spatula<br>
                 and cook until the bottom of the tortillas are lightly browned and crispy.<br>
                  Flip them over so they crisp on both sides and the cheese is melted and gooey in the middle.<br>
                   Repeat the process until finished. Garnish with cilantro and lime wedges. Serve immediately when hot.</li>
